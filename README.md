The Hospital Appointment Management System is a Java-based application developed to simplify and streamline the hospital appointment process. Built using JavaFX for the front-end, it offers a clean, user-friendly interface for all users — patients, doctors, and administrators.
Patients can register, log in, search for doctors, and book appointments with ease. Doctors can manage their availability, view appointments, and update schedules, while administrators oversee user management and system data.
